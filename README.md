# Qualcomm-Brand-Analysis
This Final Group Project for IST 6620, Business Analytics was a cumulative presentation of a semester-long project to display the skills required to produce a business analysis that produced a dashboard written in R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The objective of this project was to use R to process and analyze data from a questionnaire created and distributed to members of the public via the Qualtrics survey system to answer business questions: 

1) What customer target markets should Qualcomm focus its marketing campaign toward to increase its brand recognition as a U.S.-based semiconductor company?

2) Is there a competitive advantage of being recognized as a US-based semiconductor company that can build value for Qualcomm’s customers?

The results and the analysis of the data through data science methodologies using the R programming language show that in order for Qualcomm to improve its brand exposure in the emerging IoT market it should target 18 to 24 year-olds who use Instagram or TikTok and watch Netflix or YouTube. The results also show that there is a competitive advantage to Qualcomm being a U.S.-based semiconductor company and that it can build value throughout the supply chain Qualcomm design to contracted semiconductor foundries to high-tech product manufacturers, and finally into the hands of the consumer. This competitive advantage of being a U.S.-based semiconductor company should be the point of emphasis in future marketing campaigns.
